| How people with disabilities use digital technology: speech disabilities. | How People with Disabilities Use Digital Technology: Speech Disabilities |
| Speech disabilities affect how people speak, including not speaking, or speaking in a range of different patterns, pitches, and sounds. | Collage of 4 people doing various activities on technology devices or with them nearby. |
| Some people do not speak at all. This can include people who are Deaf, autistic, have injured or no vocal organs, or have other conditions impacting physical or cognitive speech production. | Deaf man signing to colleagues on a video conference call. |
| Unfortunately, although it's a common misperception, speaking differently is not an indication of a person's intellectual capabilities. Many people stutter, pause, or pronounce words in a range of different patterns, pitches, and utterances due to various disabilities. | Man speaks to phone laying on table beside him, but looks frustrated. |
| While you might be able to understand me, automatic speech recognition systems often don't. | Man speaks to the camera. |
| Some people use a variety of different assistive technologies to generate speech. | Man in wheelchair typing on large keyboard. |
| I use software for generating speech, which is often not recognized by automatic speech recognition. | The phrase is shown with each word highlighted as it is spoken by the computer. |
| Websites and apps that require speech input can be a barrier for people with speech disabilities, especially when they rely on automatic speech recognition. | Man using laptop is frustrated. Website shows Customer Support that is only available by telelphone. |
| Instead, websites and apps, such as customer support systems, need to provide alternatives to voice calls, like chat or email. | Man continues to use laptop at desk. |
| You can help make technology accessible to me. Accessibility: It's about people. | Man speaks this phrase then pans to collage of 12 people with different colored backgrounds. |
