| When content is accessible, people can perceive it through different senses depending on their needs and preferences. For example, some people who can't see a screen or hear audio, rely on websites and apps that can present the information in different ways. | Collage of three people using technology devices. |
| People who are blind may use assistive technology on computers and mobile phones called screen readers. These software tools read the information on the screen out loud, or they can present it in Braille. | Blind man uses laptop to explore Wikipedia-style page about birds. |

| Screen readers process websites and apps with correctly coded headings, lists, links, button, and other structures much better. | Man continues to use laptop. |
| People who are blind rely on hearing or touch, rather than sight. For video, content creators need to ensure that visual information is provided in auditory form as well. | The camera zooms to highlight an "Audio Description" button available below a video player on a website. |
| Often these descriptions of visual information can be placed in existing pauses in the audio, or the script can be created from the start with sufficient description of the scenes, characters, and other important visual information. | Man continues to use his laptop at his desk. |
| People who are deaf-blind also use screen readers to present the information using a device called a refreshable Braille display. Braille characters are a combination of raised or lowered dots, which people read by scanning over them with their fingertips. | Woman who is deaf-blind scans her fingers across a Braille device. |
| Similarly to people who are blind and deaf-blind, people who are Deaf and hard of hearing may use haptic feedback too; for example, through vibration alerts on a mobile phone instead of auditory notifications. | Deaf woman uses her laptop at a desk with her phone next to her. Her phone's camera flash blinks to alert her of a new message in a chat app. |
| People who are Deaf or hard of hearing often rely on seeing instead of hearing. For example, while watching a video they may use captions or sign language as an alternative to the audio. | Deaf man signs to colleagues on a video call, and an interpreter signs back their verbal response. |
| You can help make technology accessible to me. | Deaf-blind woman signs to the camera. |
| Accessibility: It's about people. | Collage of 12 people with different colored backgrounds. |
